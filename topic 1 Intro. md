## **1. Introduction to InfluxDB (2 Hours)**

### **What is InfluxDB?**

- InfluxDB is an open-source time-series database developed by InfluxData, optimized for handling high write and query loads.
- Designed to handle time-stamped data such as monitoring, metrics, IoT data, and financial data.

### **Why Use InfluxDB?**

- High performance for write-heavy workloads.
- Native support for time-series data.
- Flexible retention policies for data storage.
- Advanced query language (Flux) for powerful data analytics.

### **InfluxDB Architecture Overview**

- **Write and Query Engine:** Handles high-speed data ingestion and query execution.
- **Storage Engine:** Stores data in shards based on time intervals.
- **Metadata and Indexing:** Provides efficient querying by organizing data.
- **Retention Policies and Sharding:** Manage data lifespan and optimize storage.

### **Components of InfluxDB**

- **InfluxDB Server:** Core database engine.
- **Flux Query Engine:** Provides advanced querying capabilities.
- **Influx CLI:** Command-line tool for managing InfluxDB.
- **Client Libraries:** Available for Python, Go, Java, etc., for interacting with InfluxDB.

### **What:** Introduction to core concepts of InfluxDB including architecture, storage engine, indexing, and components.

### **How:** Explanation of each component with diagram representation, command-line interactions, and architecture workflow.

### **Where:** Deployment can be done on-premise, in containers, or cloud environments.

### **Architecture Workflow:**

        +-----------------+  +-----------------+  +-----------------+
```

- **InfluxDB Server:** The core engine that receives incoming data, processes queries, and stores data efficiently.
- **Write & Query Processing:** Handles write requests, query execution, and optimization.
- **Storage Engine:** Stores data in shards (time-based partitions) and applies retention policies to manage data lifespan.
- **In-Memory Index:** Enables fast lookup of time-series data.
- **Time-Series Data:** Stores actual metrics and event data.
- **Metadata Storage:** Stores additional information like bucket names, retention policies, and user roles.

### **Live Use Case:** Monitoring IoT sensor data from smart devices, analyzing temperature, humidity, and power consumption over time.

### **Practical Task:**

1. Install InfluxDB using Docker.
2. Explore architecture components by checking services and logs.
3. Create and visualize a simple time-series dataset.

```bash
# Docker Installation Command

docker run -d --name influxdb -p 8086:8086 influxdb:latest

# Setting up InfluxDB
influx setup -b example-bucket -o example-org -u admin -p password

# Checking logs to verify setup

docker logs influxdb
```

### **Writing Sample Data**

```bash
# Writing sample data using CLI
influx write -b example-bucket -o example-org -u admin -p password 'temperature,location=us-midwest value=82 1465839830100400200'
```

### **Querying Data**

```bash
# Basic Query Example
influx query 'from(bucket:"example-bucket") |> range(start: -1h)'
```

### **Code Example (Python Client):**

```python
from influxdb_client import InfluxDBClient, Point

client = InfluxDBClient(url="http://localhost:8086", token="my-token", org="example-org")
write_api = client.write_api()
query_api = client.query_api()

point = Point("temperature").tag("location", "us-midwest").field("value", 82)
write_api.write(bucket="example-bucket", org="example-org", record=point)

query = 'from(bucket:"example-bucket") |> range(start: -1h)'
result = query_api.query(query=query)
print(result)
```

### **Explanation:**

- The **InfluxDB architecture** is built for high-performance data ingestion and querying.
- The storage engine is responsible for storing time-series data in shards.
- Queries are executed using the **Flux Query Engine** which allows advanced data analysis.
- Data is written using **Line Protocol** format and can be queried using both CLI and client libraries.

### **Where:**

- Can be deployed on various platforms including Docker, Kubernetes, Linux, Windows, and MacOS.
- Suitable for use cases involving **time-series data**, such as monitoring applications, financial analytics, and IoT.

### **Live Use Case:**

- Collecting data from **smart home sensors** monitoring temperature, humidity, and power consumption.
- Storing this data in InfluxDB for real-time analytics and visualization using Grafana.

### **Outcome:**

- Understanding of the basic architecture of InfluxDB.
- Practical knowledge of writing and querying data using both CLI and Python client.
- Familiarity with Flux query language and its capabilities.
